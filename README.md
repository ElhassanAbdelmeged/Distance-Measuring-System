# Distance Measuring System

This mini project implements a distance measuring system using an ATmega32 microcontroller with a frequency of 8MHz. The system measures distance using the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor and displays the distance value on a 4x16 LCD. Here are the key specifications:

1. **Microcontroller:** Utilizes an ATmega32 Microcontroller operating at a frequency of 8MHz.

2. **Distance Measurement:** Measures distance using the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor. Refer to the "HC-SR04 Ultrasonic MT Student Tutorial" PDF file for details on interfacing with this sensor.

3. **LCD Display:** Displays the distance value on a 4x16 LCD.

4. **Layered Architecture:** The project follows a layered architecture model, including drivers for GPIO, ICU (Input Capture Unit), Ultrasonic Sensor, and LCD.

**Drivers:**
- GPIO
- ICU
- Ultrasonic Sensor (Custom Driver)
- 4x16 LCD (8-bit data mode)

**Microcontroller:**
- ATmega32 (8MHz frequency)

**Ultrasonic Driver Requirements:**
1. **Initialization:** Initialize the ICU driver as required, set up the ICU callback function, and configure the trigger pin as an output.

2. **Trigger Function:** Send the trigger pulse to the ultrasonic sensor.

3. **Distance Measurement Function:** Measure the distance by sending a trigger pulse and starting measurements using the ICU. Return the measured distance in centimeters.

4. **Callback Function:** Implement the callback function called by the ICU driver to calculate the pulse time generated by the ultrasonic sensor.

This project provides a practical implementation of a distance measuring system using an ultrasonic sensor and displaying the results on an LCD.
